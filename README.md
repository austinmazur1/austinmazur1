🤔 How'd I get here? 

I have always been facinated and drawn to web and app development, after a few years of traveling then finally settling down in Spain, I decided it was time to dive in! Starting with some online courses then eventually enrolling in a bootcamp, I fully immursed myself in the world of software development excited to pursue this as my career and continue honing my skills.
